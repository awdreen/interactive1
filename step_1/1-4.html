	<br />the hyperlink provided a diversity and decentralisation that the real world lacked. The hyperlink represented the
	<br /><div align="left">o</div><div align="right">p</div>e<div align="right">n</div>, 
	<br />interconnected spirit of the world wide web — a vision that started with its inventor, 
	<center><strong>Tim Berners-Lee.</strong></center> The hyperlink was a way to <strike>abandon</strike> centralization — all the <u>links</u>, <strike>lines</strike> and <big>hierarchies</big> — and replace them with something more d&nbsp;i&nbsp;s&nbsp;t&nbsp;r&nbsp;i&nbsp;b&nbsp;u&nbsp;t&nbsp;e&nbsp;d, a system of nodes and networks.

	Blogs gave form to that spirit of decentralization: 
	<br />They were windows into lives you’d rarely know much about;
	<br />b&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;r&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;s 
	<br />that connected different lives to each other and thereby changed them. Blogs were cafes where people exchanged diverse ideas on any and every topic you could possibly be interested in. <div align="right"><p>They were Tehran’s taxicabs writ large.</p></div>

	<center>Since I got out of jail, though, I’ve realized how much the</center> <div align="right">hyperlink has been devalued, almost made <strike>obsolete.</strike></div>
	<br />

	Nearly every social network now treats a link as just the same as it treats any other object — the same as a photo, or a piece of text — instead of seeing it as a way to make that text richer. 
	<br />You’re <strong><big>encouraged</big></strong> to post <em><small>one single</small></em> hyperlink and expose it to a quasi-democratic process of liking and plussing and hearting: 
	<br />
	<br /> Adding several links to a piece of text is usually not allowed. . .
