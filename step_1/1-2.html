<h2>The hyperlink was my currency six years ago. </h2> 
<em><h5>Stemming from the idea of the hypertext, 
<br />
the hyperlink provided a diversity and decentralisation that the real world lacked. </h5></em>
 <br /> <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hyperlink represented the open, interconnected spirit of the world wide web — 
 <br />a vision that started with its inventor, Tim Berners-Lee. The hyperlink was a way to abandon
 <br /> centralization — all the links, lines and hierarchies — and replace them with something more distributed, 
 <br />a system of nodes and networks.
<p></p>
Blogs gave form to that spirit of decentralization: They were windows into lives you’d rarely know much  
<br />about; bridges that connected different lives to each other and thereby changed them. 
 <br />Blogs were cafes where people exchanged diverse ideas on any and every topic you could possibly 
  <br />be interested in. They were Tehran’s taxicabs writ large.
<p></p>
Since I got out of jail, though, I’ve realized how much the hyperlink has been devalued, almost made obsolete.
<p></p>
Nearly every social network now treats a link as just the same as it treats any other object — the same as 
<br />a photo, or a piece of text — instead of seeing it as a way to make that text richer. You’re encouraged
<br /> to post one single hyperlink and expose it to a quasi-democratic process of liking and plussing
 <br /> and hearting: Adding several links to a piece of text is usually not allowed. Hyperlinks are 
  <br />objectivized, 
   <br />isolated, 
    <br />stripped of their powers.
